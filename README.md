# Purpose
I wanted to power a home built Star Wars inspired droid with their binary droid speak seen in the movies. I wanted a real experience with natural language understanding and keyword spotting. To achieve this, I employ Windows Speech Recognition and Speech Studio custom keywords to recognize when I’m talking to the droid, e.g., “R2 what is your name?” Once the keyword is detected, a recording of the sound for an adjustable duration is collected. The sound sample is submitted to Deep Speech and the text output is submitted to NLTK for natural language understanding. The returned payload is parsed by the code for commands to execute locally and for sound output. I use the “pronouncing” module in python to break the returned text output into one (1) of thirty-nine (39) phonemes by breaking it into syllables and assigning each syllable a frequency. The frequency is submitted to the Windows Beep API for beeping audio output.

# Notes
This code adapts the Microsoft Speech Custom Keyword python sample available through the SDK.

# Edits
## droid_speech.py

You must select which droid keyword you want. (R2, BB8, etc.)

Edit the table name to point to the included pretrained models. By default, the droid is called R4.

### Function speech_recognize_keyword_locally_from_microphone()

```
    # Creates an instance of a keyword recognition model. Update this to
    # point to the location of your keyword recognition model.
    model = speechsdk.KeywordRecognitionModel("r4.table")

    # The phrase your keyword recognition model triggers on.
    keyword = "R4"
 ```
 
You could/should adjust the filters that remove the keyword(s) from the payload before it is sent to Deep Speech. 

```
str = str.replace('are four ','').replace('Are Four ', '').replace('are Four ', '').replace('are 4 ', '').replace('our four ', '').replace('Our Four ', '').replace('our 4 ', '').replace('r 4 ', '').replace('R. for ', '')
```

# Running
`python.exe main.py`

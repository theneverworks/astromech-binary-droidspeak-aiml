# astromech-binary-droidspeak
Entirely offline Windows based keyword spotting and binary 'droid speak' beep language translation for your Astromech droid.

A new OFFLINE version of https://github.com/theneverworks/astromech-binary-droidspeak-ibm-watson.

# Prerequisites

## Python
Known to support Python 3.6, other versions not tested but may work.

## Install Pronouncing
https://pypi.org/project/pronouncing/

## Install Sounddevice
https://pypi.org/project/sounddevice/

## Install Winsound
Built in.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html

# Edits
## droid_speech.py

You must select which droid keyword you want. (R2, BB8, etc.)

Edit the table name to point to the included pretrained models. By default, the droid is called R4.

### Function speech_recognize_keyword_locally_from_microphone()

```
    # Creates an instance of a keyword recognition model. Update this to
    # point to the location of your keyword recognition model.
    model = speechsdk.KeywordRecognitionModel("r4.table")

    # The phrase your keyword recognition model triggers on.
    keyword = "R4"
 ```
 
You could/should adjust the filters that remove the keyword(s) from the payload before it is sent to Watson Assistant. This helps with accuracy but isnâ€™t required. Some of these filters will emerge though reviewing the analytics in Watson Assistant.

` str = str.replace('are four ','').replace('Are Four ', '').replace('are Four ', '').replace('are 4 ', '').replace('our four ', '').replace('Our Four ', '').replace('our 4 ', '').replace('r 4 ', '').replace('R. for ', '')

# Running
`python.exe main.py`
